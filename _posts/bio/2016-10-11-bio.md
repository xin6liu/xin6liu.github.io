## Chapter 3: Osseous[‘啊see啊斯]骨的  Wound Healing

### bone organ 
bone organ 包括了：bone tissue, bone marrow[‘卖肉]骨髓 and a surrounding connective tissue (periosteum[派瑞’osteum]骨膜)

### bone tissue 又分为：
1. cortical[‘扣忒抠] bone 皮质骨
2. trabecular[戳’白壳有了] bone 松质骨
(cancellous[can色乐斯] bone net work of spongy trabeculae)


### 3 organizational levels of the composition of bone:

___
>1.sub nano and nanostructure:
-**inorganic crystals and ions**
-**protein**
-**collagen fibers made up of multiple triple helices**

___
>2.sub micro and microstructures:
**lamellae[来’么累]**
mineralized collagen fibiers are planar or concentric sheets around canal
>
>**trabeculae[戳’白壳有了]**
- trabeculae
- aligned along lines off stress
>
>**Haversian[哈version] systems (secondary osteons[‘奥斯剃恩])**
- lamellae-canal units
- blood vessels, lymphatic vessels and nerves found within canals
>
>**bone-forming osteoblasts mature into osteocytes[‘奥斯剃噢site]骨细胞**
- osteocytes communicate and exchange nutrients within the osteon
- Volkmann’s canals (carrying blood vessels) connect osteons together
- osteons are highly vascularized

___
>3.macrostructure:
**cortical[‘扣忒抠]** and **trabecular[戳’白壳有了] bone**

___

### ossification[‘啊see fi’cation]骨化

1. **Endochondral[endo‘康卓] ossification软骨内骨化**
formation of bones that are longer than they are wide (femur, humerus)
胎儿的大多数骨，如四肢骨、躯干骨及颅底骨等，均主要以软骨内成骨的方式发生。这种骨发生既包括与膜内成骨相似的发生过程，又包括软骨的持续生长与退化，以及软骨组织不断被骨组织取代的特有发生过程

2. **Intermembranous [inter’满bra呢斯] ossification 膜内成骨**
formation of flat or irregularly shaped bones (cranial bones)
这种方式是先由**间充质(MSCs)**分化成为**胚性结缔组织膜**，然后在此膜内成骨。人体的顶骨、额骨和锁骨等即以此种方式发生。

>两种ossification 都是由**mesenchymal[么zen科mal] stem[stanm] cells (MSCs) 间充质干细胞** 演化来的
- MSC cell migration, proliferation[pro累夫ration]增殖, shape and metabolic function are dependent upon local concentrations of hyaluronan (HY) that is present in ECM
- *bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs)* are essential for healthy embryonic development, mitosis, differentiation



### Osteogenic[奥斯剃噢'genic] Growth Factors

Ossification involves several growth factors including **bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs)**,**vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)**, **fibroblast growth factor (FGF)** and **PDGF**

**BMPs (bone morphogenic proteins)**
over 20 identified with direct and indirect effects on MSCs 

- Morhogenesis
- Differentiation
- Mitogenesis (the induction of mitosis)
- Chemotaxis (the movement of cellsin response to a chemical stimulus)

BMPs bind to cell surface receptors inducing intracellular pathways that modulate gene-transcription

**Platelet-Derived Growth Factors (PDGFs)**

PDGFs induce chemotaxis and mitogenesis of mesenchymal-derived cells 	(fibroblasts,osteoblasts, etc.)
PDGFs promote osseous wound healing

### Types of Osseous Healing

bone is capable of healing itself to preinjury strength and function

Healing involves bioactive proteins, physical and chemical factors and cells

Starts with hematoma formation in clotting phase 

followed by platelet activation, the release of cytokines and growth factors that initiate subsequent steps in the wound-healing cascade involving 

- Inflammatory phase
- Reparative phase
- Remodeling phase

### Spontaneous Healing

- liver and bone are capable of spontaneous regeneration
-requires viable cells, adequate nutrition, vascularity, appropriate oxygen content and highly active periosteal cells (found mainly in children)
	-periosteal cells (cellular fibrous sheet that covers external surface of the bone) 
	- cambial layer (inner surface of the periosteum) is a source of new bone-forming cells 		needed for spontaneous skeletal healing 
- Cutting cones consist of osteoclasts that drill down into
  bone matrix and osteoblasts that secrete osteoid
  to reestablish osseous continuity between the two 
   ends of the fracture
- Osteoclasts resorbs bone tissue
- bone-forming osteoblasts mature into osteocytes
Fracture Healing without surgical intervention			Cutting cone

-influenced by stability of segments at fracture site, vascularity, availability of osteoprogenitor cells (OPCs) and MSCs

Healing by one of two processes:
	1) direct mechanism
	2) cartilaginous intermediary

### Fracture healing following surgical intervention

1) Primary fracture repair
	- rigid fixation to immobilize bony fragments to gain mechanical stability
	- capillaries and osteogenic cells form new bone at site of fracture
	
	a) Gap healing (6 weeks)
	- small gap across fracture despite rigid fixation
	- gaps <0.3 mm  filled with lamellar bone
	- gaps up to 1 mm initially filled with woven bone which matures into lamellar bone

	b) Contact healing
	- no gap between bone segments
	- cortical bone healing process, bone growth of 1-2 μm/day
	- rigid support needed resorb and remodeling process proceeds

2) Secondary fracture repair
	- occurs in fractures that heal spontaneously or treated with nonrigid fixation
	- mechanism consists of 3 stages: 
	1) early inflammatory (2 weeks)
	2) repair –callus formation externally and internally between the bone ends, limited strength (4-6 weeks)
	3) remodeling – chemotactic, mitogenic and differentiating activities (takes months)

### Graft Healing
	- for breaks with large discontinouous segments
	- bony continuity provided by autogeneous, allogeneic or xenogenic bone
	- healing at graft site by 3 overlapping mechanisms
	1) Osteogenesis – new bone formation from ostoblastic cells within wound or 
					transplanted with graft
	2) Osteoinduction – bone formation from BMP induced transformation of 
					osteoprogenitor cells (OPCs) into osteoblasts
	3) Osteoconduction – bone formed by host-derived or transplanted OPCs to scaffold


### Promotion of Osseous Healing with Biologics

Employ existing physiological mechanisms but prevent scarring (bone replaced by fibrous tissue)

Critical-sized defect (CSD) is the size of the bone gap that will not heal spontaneously
composition at the CSD must be administered to promote regeneration of osseous tissue

### Composition used to promote bone regeneration at the Critical-sized defect  (CSD)

A combination of:

Scaffolds with biological and biomechanical requirements including being 
-biodegradable, non cytotoxic
-proper resorption properties
-porosity allowing cellular migration required 
- Mimic extracellular matricies
- Allow for cell attachment
Examples of scaffolds:
		- Autograft
		- Allogenic bone graft
		- Xenogenic material (nonimmunogenic)
		- Natural polymers (collagen)
		- Synthetic polymers (poly(a-hydroxy acids))
		- ceramics made of calcium phosphates, calcium sulfate and Bioglass.

2) Cells (MSCs, adiposites) and proteins (BMPs, PDGF, VEGF,  etc. )
	-needed to promote bone regeneration, healing, proper vascularization, etc.
