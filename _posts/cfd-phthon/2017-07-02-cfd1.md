$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0$

给出初始条件：$u(x,0)=u_0(x)$，这样求得的解为：$u(x,t)=u_0(x-ct)$.

$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0$ 化成 discrete equation 为：

$$ \frac{u_i^{n+1}-u_i^n}{\Delta t} + c \frac{u_i^n - u_{i-1}^n}{\Delta x} = 0 $$

Where $n$ and $n+1$ are two consecutive steps in time, while $i-1$ and $i$ are two neighboring points of the discretized $x$ coordinate.

$$u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - c \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}(u_i^n-u_{i-1}^n)$$

`numpy` is a library that provides a bunch of useful matrix operations akin to MATLAB

`matplotlib` is a 2D plotting library that we will use to plot our results

`time` and `sys` provide basic timing functions that we'll use to slow down animations for
