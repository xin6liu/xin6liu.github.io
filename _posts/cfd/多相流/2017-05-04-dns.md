## Introduction
Not only are the equations, governing the fluid flow in both phases, **highly nonlinear**, but the **position of the phase boundary** must generally be found as a part of the solution. Exact analytical solutions therefore exist only for the simplest problems such as the **steady-state motion of bubbles and droplets in Stokes flow**, **linear inviscid waves and small oscillations of bubbles and droplets**.  
两相控制流体流动的方程式，不仅**高度非线性**，而且**两相边界的位置**通常也必须作为解的一部分。因此，精确分析解仅存在于最简单的问题中，例如**斯托克斯流动中的气泡和液滴的稳态运动**，**线性不粘波和气泡和液滴的小振荡**。

Experimental studies of multiphase flows are not easy either. For many flows of practical interest the **length scales are small**, **the time scales are short** and **optical access to much of the flow is limited**.  
多相流的实验研究也不容易。对于许多具有实际意义的流动，长度尺度小，时间尺度短，对大部分流动的观察是受限的。

Although much has been accomplished, simulations of multiphase flows have remained far behind homogeneous flows where direct numerical simulations (DNS)—where the governing equations are solved using sufficiently fine grids so that all continuum time- and length-scales are fully resolved—have become a standard tool in turbulence research. 
虽然已经完成了很多工作，但是多相流的模拟仍然远远落后于直接数值模拟（DNS）的均匀流动，其中使用足够细的网格来解决控制方程，使得所有连续的时间和长度尺度都被完全解决 - 已经成为湍流研究中的标准工具。

## Examples of multiphase flows
Bubbles are found in a large number of industrial applications. For example they carry vapor away from hot surfaces in boiling heat transfer, disperse gasses and provide stirring in various chemical processing systems and also affect the propagation of sound in the ocean. To design systems that involve bubbly flows it is necessary to understand how the collective rise velocity of many bubbles depends on the void fraction and the bubble size distribution, how bubbles disperse and how they stir up the fluid. Figure 1.1 is a picture of air bubbles rising through water in a small bubble column. The average bubble diameter is about 2.2 mm and the void fraction is approximately 0.75%. At these parameters the bubbles rise with an average velocity of roughly 0.27 m/s, but since the bubbles are not all of the same size they will generally rise with different velocities. 气泡在大量的工业应用中被发现。例如，它们在沸腾的传热，分散气体中将热蒸汽从热表面带走，并在各种化学处理系统中提供搅拌并且还影响声音在海洋中的传播。为了设计涉及气泡流的系统，有必要了解许多气泡的集体上升速度如何取决于空隙分数和气泡尺寸分布，气泡如何分散以及它们如何搅拌流体。图1.1是在小泡罩塔中通过水升起的气泡图。平均气泡直径约为2.2mm，空隙率约为0.75％。在这些参数下，气泡以大约0.27m / s的平均速度上升，但由于气泡的尺寸并不都一样，它们通常以不同的速度上升。

To generate sprays for combustion, coating and painting, irrigation, humidification and a large number of other applications a liquid jet must be atomized. Predicting the rate of atomization and the resulting droplet size distribution, as well as their velocity, is critical to the successful design of such processes. In Fig. 1.2, a liquid jet is ejected from a nozzle of diameter 8 mm with a velocity of 0.6 m/s. To accelerate its breakup, the jet is injected into a co-flowing air stream, with a velocity of 35 m/s. Initially, the shear between the air and the liquid leads to large axisymmetric waves but as the waves move downstream the air pulls long filaments from the crest of the wave. The filaments then break into droplets by a capillary instability. See Marmottant and Villermaux (2001) and Villermaux et al. (2004) for details. 为了产生燃烧，喷涂和喷涂，灌溉，加湿和大量其他应用的喷雾，液体喷射必须被雾化。预测雾化速率和产生的液滴尺寸分布及其速度对于成功设计这些工艺至关重要。在图如图1.2所示，液体射流以0.6m / s的速度从直径8mm的喷嘴喷出。为了加速其分解，喷射流以35m / s的速度注入共流动空气流中。最初，空气和液体之间的剪切导致大的轴对称波，但是随着波浪向下游移动，空气从波浪顶部拉长长丝。然后，细丝通过毛细管不稳定性而分解成液滴。参见Marmottant和Villermaux（2001）和Villermaux等人（2004）。

Droplets impacting solid or liquid surfaces generally splash, often disrupting the surface significantly. Rain droplets falling on the ground often result in soil erosion, for example. But droplet impact can also help to increase the heat transfer, such as in quenching and spray cooling, and rain often greatly enhances the mixing at the ocean surface. Figure 1.3 shows the splash created when a droplet of a diameter of about three millimeters, released from nearly half a meter above the surface, impacts a liquid layer a little over a droplet-diameter deep. The impact of the droplet creates a liquid crater and a rim that often breaks into droplets. As the crater collapses, air bubbles are sometimes trapped in the liquid. 影响固体或液体表面的液滴通常会飞溅，经常会破坏表面。落在地上的雨滴通常会导致土壤侵蚀。但是液滴冲击也有助于增加传热，如淬火和喷雾冷却，而雨水通常会大大增强海洋表面的混合。图1.3显示了当从表面上方近半米处释放的直径约为三毫米的液滴在液滴直径深处稍微冲击液体层时，产生的飞溅。液滴的影响产生液体火山口和经常破碎成液滴的边缘。当火山口塌陷时，气泡有时被困在液体中。

While bubbles are often generated by air injection into a pool of liquid or are formed by entrainment at a free surface, such as when waves break, they also frequently form when a liquid changes phase into vapor. Such a phase change is often nucleated at a solid surface and can take place either by heating the liquid above the saturation temperature, as in boiling, or by lowering the pressure below the vapor pressure, as in cavitation. Figure 1.4 shows massive cavitation at the leading edge of an airfoil submerged in water. The chord of the airfoil is 7.6 cm, the flow speed is 13.7 m/s from left to right, and the increase in the liquid velocity as it passes over the leading edge of the airfoil leads to a drop in pressure that is sufficiently large so that the liquid “boils”. As the vapor bubbles move into regions of higher pressure at the back of the airfoil, they collapse. However, residual gases, dissolved in the liquid, diffuse into the bubbles during their existence, leaving traces that are visible after the vapor has condensed. 虽然气泡通常通过空气注入液体池中或通过在自由表面的夹带而形成，例如当波浪破裂时，当液体将相变成蒸气时，它们也经常形成。这样的相变通常在固体表面成核，并且可以通过在饱和温度下加热液体，如在沸腾中，或者通过将空气压力降低到蒸气压以下来进行。图1.4显示了淹没在水中的翼型的前缘处的大量空化现象。翼型弦为7.6厘米，从左到右的流速为13.7米/秒，当液面速度超过翼型的前缘时，液体速度的增加导致压力下降，足够大，因此液体“沸腾”。当气泡移动到机翼后部的较高压力区域时，它们就会倒塌。然而，溶解在液体中的残余气体在其存在期间扩散到气泡中，留下在蒸气冷凝后可见的痕迹。

In many multiphase systems one phase is a solid. Suspensions of solid particles in liquids or gases are common and the definition of multiphase flows is sometimes extended to cover flows through or over complex stationary solids, such as packed beds, porous media, forests and cities. The main difference between gas-liquid multiphase flows and solid-gas and solid-liquid multiphase flows is usually that the interface maintains its shape in the latter cases, even though the location of the solid may change. In some instances, however, that is not the case. Flexible solids can change their shape in response to fluid flow and during solidification or erosion the boundary can evolve, sometimes into shapes that are just as convoluted as encountered for gas-liquid systems. When a metal alloy solidifies, the solute is initially rejected by the solid phase. This leads to constitutional undercooling and an instability of the solidification front. The solute-rich phase eventually solidifies, but with a very different composition than the material that first became solid. The size, shape and composition of the resulting microstructures determine the properties of the material and those are usually sensitively dependent on the various process parameters. A representative micrograph of an Al-Si alloy prepared by metallographic techniques and etching to reveal phase boundaries and interfaces is shown in Fig. 1.5. The light gray phase is almost pure aluminum and solidifies first, but constitutional undercooling leads to dendritic structures of a size measured in few tens of micrometers. 在许多多相系统中，一相是固体。固体颗粒在液体或气体中的悬浮液是常见的，并且多相流的定义有时被扩展以覆盖通过或复杂的固定固体（例如填充床，多孔介质，森林和城市）的流动。气 - 液多相流与固气和固 - 液多相流的主要区别通常是在后一种情况下界面保持其形状，即使固体的位置可能改变。但在某些情况下，情况并非如此。柔性固体可以响应于流体流动而改变它们的形状，并且在固化或侵蚀期间，边界可以演化，有时变成与气液体系统遇到的卷曲形状。当金属合金凝固时，溶质最初被固相拒绝。这导致结构过冷和固化前沿的不稳定性。富含溶质的相最终固化，但是具有与首先变成固体的材料非常不同的组成。所得微结构的尺寸，形状和组成决定了材料的性质，而这些材料的尺寸，形状和组成通常敏感地取决于各种工艺参数。通过金相技术制备的Al-Si合金的代表性显微照片和蚀刻以揭示相界和界面如图1所示。 1.5。浅灰阶段几乎是纯铝并首先固化，但是结构过冷会导致在几十微米内测量的尺寸的树枝状结构。

Living systems provide an abundance of multiphase flow examples. Suspended blood cells and aerosol in pulmonary flow are obvious examples at the “body” scale, as are the motion of organs and even complete individuals. But even more complex systems, such as the motion of a flock of birds through air and a school of fish through water, are also multiphase flows. Figure 1.6 show a large number of yellow-tailed goatfish swimming together and coordinating their movement. An understanding of the motion of both a single fish as well as the collective motion of a large school may have im- plication for population control and harvesting, as well as the construction of mechanical swimming and flying devices. 生活系统提供丰富的多相流程实例。肺动脉中的悬浮血细胞和气溶胶是“身体”规模的明显例子，器官甚至完整个体的运动也是如此。但是更复杂的系统，例如一群鸟类通过空气运动，一群鱼通过水运动，也是多相流。图1.6显示了大量黄尾鲑鱼游泳在一起，协调他们的运动。了解单一鱼类的动议以及大型学校的集体动议，可能对人口控制和收获以及机械游泳和飞行装置的建设都有影响。
