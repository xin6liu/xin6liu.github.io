orthogonal basis bubble function finite element method 

## Summary
In this study, a finite element method based on a phase-field model for gas – liquid two-phase flow is proposed. MINI element based on a **bubble function element stabilisation method** is employed for the incompressible Navier – Stokes equations. The **Cahn–Hilliard equation** is employed to **estimate** the interface of gas and liquid. The **orthogonal basis bubble function element** is used to **solve** the Cahn–Hilliard equation. In particular, a detailed explanation for solving the Cahn–Hilliard equation based on a finite element method is given. 

简单来说，就是**Cahn–Hilliard equation** 用来判断边界， **orthogonal basis bubble function element** 用来解**Cahn–Hilliard equation**。

## Introduction
### vof 和 pfm 方法比较：
The interface function of the VOF method is discontinuous at the interface of the liquid and gaseous phases. On the other hand, the interface function of the PFM varies continuously or smoothly in the vicinity of the interface of the liquid and gaseous phases. In terms of numerical stability, it is more advantageous to solve a function that is continuous at an interface rather than a function that is discontinuous at the interface.
