Two separate studies were conducted with K-ICE using this single ASTF air flowfield solution. 

The first study included a series of parametric tests using an extracted slice of the one quarter domain solution, which incorporated flow between two spray bars extending from the center of the tunnel to the wall. The spray nozzles were placed according to actual geometries and several varying conditions were run to witness the effects of parameter changes on the flowfield. 

In the second study, the complete one-quarter domain was used for computations for two different nozzle spray arrangements. Both studies are described next.

使用这种单一ASTF空气流场解决方案，用K-ICE进行了两项独立研究。

第一项研究包括一系列参数测试，使用四分之一域解决方案的提取切片，其中包含从隧道中心延伸到墙壁的两根喷杆之间的流动。 根据实际几何形状放置喷嘴，并运行几个不同的条件以观察参数变化对流场的影响。

在第二项研究中，完整的四分之一域被用于计算两种不同的喷嘴喷雾装置。 下面介绍这两项研究。
