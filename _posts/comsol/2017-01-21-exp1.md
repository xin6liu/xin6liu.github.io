(原谅我只挑重点翻译了，还有一些物理名词我也赖的查中文意思了，比如stress, strain什么的我们学的时候就是英文，就按我的习惯吧。。)

Small heating circuits find use in many applications. For example, in manufacturing processes they heat up reactive fluids. The device used consists of an electrically resistive layer deposited on a glass plate. The layer causes Joule heating when a voltage is applied to the circuit. The layer’s properties determine the amount of heat produced.

一般加热装置由一层沉积在玻璃板上的electrically resistive layer组成（如图1）。当电路加上电压时，这层electrically resistive layer会产生焦耳热。而这层材料的性质则决定了有多少热产生。


In this particular application, you must observe three important design considerations: 
1. Non-invasive heating
2. Minimal deflection of the heating device 
3. Avoidance of overheating the process fluid   


在这个特殊的应用中你应该观察到三个重要的设计考虑：
1. 非扩散加热
2. 加热装置的最小误差
3. 避免加热过头


The heater must also work without failure. You achieve the first and second requirements by inserting a glass plate between the heating circuit and the fluid; it acts as a conducting separator. Glass is an ideal material for both these purposes because it is non-reactive and has a low coefficient of thermal expansion.

为了达成1和2，你可以在电路(heating circuit)和液体(fluid)之间插入一层玻璃板(glass plate)，它可以隔离导热(conducting separator)。对于1和2来说玻璃都是一个好的选择，因为玻璃**non-reactive**而且**coefficient of thermal expansion**很低。
You must also avoid overheating due to the risk of self-ignition of the reactive fluid stream. Ignition is also the main reason for separating the electrical circuit from direct contact with the fluid. The heating device is tailored for each application, making virtual prototyping very important for manufacturers. 

为了防止液体的self-ignition，你必须避免过度加热。这也是要把electrical circuit 和 fluid 分开的原因。

  
For heating circuits in general, detachment of the resistive layer often determines the failure rate. This is caused by excessive thermally induced interfacial stresses. Once the layer has detached, it gets locally overheated, which accelerates the detachment.  

对于一般的heating circuits 来说，resistive layer的脱离往往决定了失败率。这是因为过大的thermally induced interfacial stresses。一旦resistive layer分离，它将局部加热过度，且加速了分离。

Finally, in the worst case, the circuit might overheat and burn. From this perspective, it is also important to study the interfacial tension due to the different thermal-expansion coefficients of the resistive layer and the substrate as well as the differences in temperature. The geometric shape of the layer is a key parameter to design circuits for proper functioning. You can investigate all of the above-mentioned aspects by modeling the circuit. 

最坏的情况，电路可能会加热过度并且燃烧起来。从这点来看，学习**界面张力(interfacial tension)**很重要，它是由resistive layer和基底的thermal-expansion系数不同，以及温度不同造成的。几何形状是设计电路合适功能的关键。


This multiphysics example simulates the electrical heat generation, the heat transfer, and the mechanical stresses and deformations of a heating circuit device. The model uses the Heat Transfer interface of the Heat Transfer module in combination with the Shell, Conductive Media DC interface from the AC/DC Module and the Solid, Stress-Strain and Shell interfaces from the Structural Mechanics Module.
