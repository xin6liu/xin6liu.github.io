## Simple flows (Re=0 and Re=∞) 简单流
In the limit of either very large or very small viscosity (as measured by the Reynolds number, see Chapter 2.2.6), it is sometimes possible to simplify considerably the flow description by either ignoring inertia completely (Stokes flow) or by ignoring viscous effects completely (inviscid flow). For inviscid flows it is usually further necessary to assume that the flow is irrotational, except at fluid interfaces. Most success has been achieved for disperse flows of un-deformable spheres where, in both these limits, it is possible to reduce the governing equations to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the particle positions. 在非常大或非常小的粘度（通过雷诺数测量的参见第2.2.6节）的极限中，有时可以通过完全忽略惯性（斯托克斯流量）或忽略粘性效应来大大简化流量描述完全（不含流）。对于非粘性流，通常还需要假设流体是非旋转的，除了在流体界面处。对于不可变形的球体的分散流体已经取得了最大的成功，在这两个极限中，可以将控制方程式减少到用于粒子位置的耦合常微分方程（ODE）系统。

## Finite Reynolds number flows 有限雷诺数流
### MAC
For intermediate Reynolds numbers it is necessary to solve the **full Navier- Stokes equations**. Nearly ten years after Birkhoff’s effort to simulate the **inviscid Rayleigh-Taylor problem** by a **boundary integral technique**, the **Marker-and-Cell (MAC) method** was developed at Los Alamos by Harlow and collaborators. In the MAC method the fluid is identified by **marker particles distributed throughout the fluid region** and the **governing equations** solved on **a regular grid that covers both the fluid-filled and the empty part of the domain**.   
对于中间雷诺数，有必要解决**完整**的Navier-Stokes方程。在Birkhoff努力通过**边界积分技术**模拟**无粘性Rayleigh-Taylor问题**近十年之后，Harlow和合作者在Los Alamos开发了**Marker-and-Cell（MAC）方法**。在MAC方法中，流体由**分布在整个流体区域的标记颗粒**和**控制方程**定义，控制方程在**包括了流体填充和空余的部分的规则网格**上解出。

The method was introduced in Harlow and Welch (1965) and two sample computations of the so-called dam breaking problem were shown in that first paper. Several papers quickly followed: Harlow and Welch (1966) examined the Rayleigh-Taylor problem (Fig. 1.8) and Harlow and Shannon (1967) studied the splash when a droplet hits a liquid surface. As originally implemented, the MAC method assumed a free surface so there was only one fluid involved. This required boundary conditions to be applied at the surface and the fluid in the rest of the domain to be completely passive. The Los Alamos group realized, however, that the same methodology could be applied to two-fluid problems. Daly (1969b) computed the evolution of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability for finite density ratios and Daly and Pracht (1968) examined the initial motion of density currents. Surface tension was then added by Daly (1969a) and the method again used to examine the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The MAC method quickly attracted a small group of followers that used it to study several problems: Chan and Street (1970) applied it to free surface waves, Foote (1973) and Foote (1975) simulated the oscillations of an axisymmetric droplet and the collision of a droplet with a rigid wall, respectively, and Chapman and Plesset (1972) and Mitchell and Hammitt (1973) followed the collapse of a cavitation bubble. While the Los Alamos group did a number of computations of various problems in the sixties and early seventies and Harlow described the basic idea in a Scientific American article (Harlow and Fromm, 1965), the enormous potential of this newfound tool did not, for the most part, capture the fancy of the fluid mechanics research community. 该方法在Harlow和Welch（1965）中引入，并且在第一篇论文中显示了所谓的大坝破坏问题的两个样本计算。 Harlow和Welch（1966）研究了Rayleigh-Taylor问题（图1.8），Harlow和Shannon（1967）研究了当液滴撞击液体表面时的飞溅。如最初实现的那样，MAC方法假设一个自由表面，因此只涉及一个流体。这需要在表面施加边界条件，并且其余部分的流体被完全被动。然而，洛斯阿拉莫斯集团意识到，同样的方法可以应用于双流体问题。 Daly（1969b）计算了有限密度比的Rayleigh-Taylor不稳定性的演化，Daly和Pracht（1968）研究了密度电流的初始运动。然后通过Daly（1969a）加入表面张力，该方法再次用于检验Rayleigh-Taylor不稳定性。 MAC方法很快吸引了一小群使用它来研究几个问题的追随者：陈和街（1970）将其应用于自由表面波，Foote（1973）和Foote（1975）模拟了轴对称液滴的振荡和碰撞分别具有刚性壁的液滴和Chapman和Plesset（1972）和Mitchell和Hammitt（1973），在气蚀泡沫崩溃之后。虽然洛斯阿拉莫斯集团在六十年代初期对多个问题进行了一些计算，哈洛在“美国科学美国”（Harlow and Fromm，1965）中描述了基本思想，但是这种新发现的工具的巨大潜力并没有大部分时间，捕捉了流体力学研究界的奇特。

Although the MAC method was designed specifically for multi-fluid problems (hence the M for Markers!) it was also the first method to successfully solve the Navier-Stokes equation using the **primitive variables (velocity and pressure)**. The **staggered grid** used was a novelty and today it is a common practice to refer to any method using **a projection based time integration on a staggered grid** as a MAC method (see Chapter 3).    
虽然MAC方法是专为多流体问题设计的（因此M表示Markers）。但也是使用原始变量（速度和压力）成功解决Navier-Stokes方程的第一种方法。所使用的交错网格是一个新奇事物，而今天通常的做法是使用基于投影的时间积分作为MAC方法在交错网格上进行的任何方法（参见第3章）。

### VOF
The next generation of methods for multi-fluid flows evolved gradually from the MAC method. It was already clear in the Harlow and Welch (1965) paper that the **marker particles could cause inaccuracies** and of the many algorithmic ideas explored by the Los Alamos group, the replacement of the particles by a marker function soon became the most popular alternative. Thus the **Volume-of-Fluid (VOF)** method was born. VOF was first discussed in a refereed journal article by Hirt and Nichols (1981) but the method originated earlier (DeBar, 1974; Noh and Woodward, 1976). The basic problem with **advecting a marker function** is the **numerical diffusion** resulting from working with a **cell-averaged marker function** (see Chapter 4).    
下一代多流体流动方法逐渐从MAC方法演变而来。在Harlow和Welch（1965）的文章中已经清楚，标记颗粒可能会导致不准确和Los Alamos组探索的许多算法思想，用标记功能替代颗粒很快就成为最流行的替代方案。因此，体积流体（VOF）方法诞生了。 Hirt和Nichols（1981）的评论文章首先讨论了VOF，但是该方法起源于早期（DeBar，1974; Noh和Woodward，1976）。平滑标记功能的基本问题是使用细胞平均标记功能产生的数值扩散（参见第4章）。

To **prevent the marker function from continuing to diffuse**, the **interface is “reconstructed”** in the VOF method in such a way that **the marker does not start to flow into a new cell until the current cell is full**.    为了防止标记功能继续扩散，界面在VOF方法中被“重建”，使得标记在当前单元格已满之前不会开始流入新单元格。

The one-dimensional implementation of this idea is essentially trivial and in the early implementation of VOF, the interface in each cell was simply assumed to be a vertical plane for advection in the horizontal direction and a horizontal plane for advection in the vertical direction. This relatively crude reconstruction often lead to large amount of “floatsam and jetsam” (small unphysical droplets that break away from the interface) that degraded the accuracy of the computation. To improve the representation, Youngs (1982) and Ashgriz and Poo (1991) and others introduced more complex reconstructions of the interface, representing it with a line (two dimensions) or a plane (three dimensions) that could be oriented arbitrarily in such a way as to best fit the interface. This increased the complexity of the method considerably but resulted in greatly improved advection of the marker function.    
这个想法的一维实现基本上是微不足道的，并且在早期实现VOF中，每个单元格中的界面被简单地假定为水平方向的平流垂直平面和垂直方向的平流水平面。这种相对粗糙的重建通常导致大量的“floatsam和jetsam”（小的非物理液滴离开界面），这降低了计算的准确性。为了提高代表性，Youngs（1982）和Ashgriz和Poo（1991）等人引入了更复杂的界面重建，用一条线（二维）或一个平面（三维）代表它，可以在这样一个方式最适合接口。这显着增加了方法的复杂性，但是极大地提高了标记功能的平流。

Even with **higher-order representation of the fluid interface in each cell**, the **accurate computation of surface tension** remained a major problem. In his simulations of surface tension effects on the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, using the MAC method, Daly (1969b) introduced **explicit surface markers** for this purpose. However, the premise behind the development of the VOF method was to **get away from using any kind of surface marker** so that the **surface tension** had to be obtained from the **marker function** instead. This was achieved by Brackbill et al. (1992) who showed that the **curvature (and hence surface tension)** could be computed by taking the **discrete divergence of the marker function**. A “conservative” version of this **“continuum surface force”** method was developed by Lafaurie et al. (1994). The VOF method has been extended in various ways by a number of authors. In addition to better ways to **reconstruct the interface** (Rider and Kothe, 1998; Scardovelli and Zaleski, 2000; Aulisa et al., 2007) and **compute the surface tension** (Renardy and Renardy, 2002; Popinet, 2009), **more advanced advection schemes for the momentum equation** and **better solvers for the pressure equation**have been introduced (see Rudman, 1997, for example). Other refinement include the use of sub-cells to keep the interface as sharp as possible (Chen et al., 1997a). VOF methods are in widespread use today and many commercial codes include VOF to track interfaces and free surfaces. Figure 1.9 shows one example of a computation of the splash made when a liquid droplet hits a free surface, done by a modern VOF method. We will discuss the use of VOF extensively in later Chapters. 即使每个单元中流体界面的高阶表示，表面张力的精确计算仍然是一个主要问题。在他对Rayleigh-Taylor不稳定性的表面张力影响的模拟中，使用MAC方法，Daly（1969b）为此目的引入了明确的表面标记。然而，VOF方法的发展背后的前提是避免使用任何种类的表面标记，从而必须从标记功能获得表面张力。这是由Brackbill等人（1992），他们表明可以通过采取标记函数的离散发散来计算曲率（和表面张力）。这种“连续表面力”方法的“保守”版本由Lafaurie等人开发（1994）。许多作者已经以各种方式扩展了VOF方法。除了更好的方法重建界面（Rider和Kothe，1998; Scardovelli和Zaleski，2000; Aulisa等，2007），并计算表面张力（Renardy和Renardy，2002; Popinet，2009），更先进的对流方案对于动量方程，已经介绍了压力方程的更好的求解器（例如参见Rudman，1997）。其他改进包括使用子单元来保持界面尽可能的清晰（Chen et al。，1997a）。 VOF方法在当今广泛使用，许多商业代码包括用于跟踪接口和自由表面的VOF。图1.9显示了通过现代VOF方法完成的液滴撞击自由表面时的飞溅计算的一个示例。我们将在后面的章节中广泛讨论VOF的使用。

The basic ideas behind the MAC and the VOF methods gave rise to several new approaches in the early nineties. Unverdi and Tryggvason (1992) introduced a Front-Tracking method for multi-fluid flows where the interface was marked by connected marker points. The markers are used to advect the material properties (such as density and viscosity) and to compute surface tension, but the rest of computations is done on a fixed grid as in the VOF method. Although using connected markers to update the material function was new, marker particles had already been used by Daly (1969a) who used them to evaluate surface tension in simulations with the MAC method, in the Immersed-Boundary Method of Peskin (1977) for one-dimensional elastic fibers in homogeneous viscous fluids and in the Vortex-in-Cell method of Tryggvason and Aref (1983) for two-fluid interfaces in a Hele-Shaw cell, for example. The Front-Tracking method of Unverdi and Tryggvason (1992) has been very successful for simulations of finite Reynolds number flows of immiscible fluids and Tryggvason and collaborators have used it to explore a large number of problems. MAC和VOF方法背后的基本思想在九十年代初引入了几种新的方法。 Unverdi和Tryggvason（1992）引入了一种用于多流体的前跟踪方法，其中界面由连接的标记点标记。标记用于平流材料性质（如密度和粘度）并计算表面张力，但其余的计算方法在VOF方法中在固定网格上进行。虽然使用连接的标记来更新材料功能是新的，但Daly（1969a）已经使用了标记颗粒，他们使用它们来评估用MAC方法进行的模拟中的表面张力，在Peskin的浸入式边界方法（1977）中，一个例如，均质粘性流体中的三维弹性纤维和Tryggvason和Aref（1983）的Vortex-in-Cell方法用于Hele-Shaw电池中的双流体界面。 Unverdi和Tryggvason（1992）的前跟踪方法对于混合流体的有限雷诺数流动的模拟非常成功，Tryggvason和协作者已经使用它来探索大量的问题。

The early nineties also saw the introduction of the Level-Set, the CIP, and the Phase-Field methods to track fluid interfaces on stationary grids. The Level-Set method was introduced by Osher and Sethian (1988), but its first use to track fluid interfaces appears to be in the work of Sussman et al. (1994) and Chang et al. (1996) who used it to simulate the rise of bubbles and the fall of droplets in two-dimensions. An axisymmetric version was used subsequently by Sussman and Smereka (1997) to examine the behavior of bubbles and droplets. Unlike the VOF method, where a discontinuous marker function is advected with the flow, in the Level-Set method a continuous level-set function is used. The interface is then identified with the zero contour of the level-set function. To reconstruct the material properties of the flow (density and viscosity, for example) a marker function is constructed from the level-set function. The marker function is given a smooth transition zone from one fluid to the next, thus increasing the regularity of the interface over the VOF method where the interface is confined to only one grid space. However, this mapping from the level-set function to the marker function requires the level-set function to maintain the same shape near the interface and to deal with this problem, Sussman et al. (1994) introduced a reinitialization procedure where the level-set function is adjusted in such a way that its value is equal to the shortest distance to the interface at all times. This step was critical in making level-sets work for fluid-dynamics simulations. Surface tension is found in the same way as in the continuous surface force technique introduced for VOF methods by Brackbill et al. (1992). The early implementation of the Level-Set method did not conserve mass very well and a number of improvements and extension followed its original introduction. Sussman et al. (1998) and Sussman and Fatemi (1999) introduced ways to improved mass conservation, Sussman et al. (1999) coupled level-set track- ing with adaptive grid refinement and a hybrid VOF/Level-Set method was developed by Sussman and Puckett (2000), for example. 九十年代初期，还引入了Level-Set，CIP和Phase-Field方法来跟踪固定网格上的流体接口。 Level-Set方法由Osher和Sethian（1988）引入，但它首先用于跟踪流体界面似乎在Sussman等人的工作中。 （1994）和Chang等人（1996），他用它来模拟气泡的上升和二维液滴的下降。 Sussman和Smereka（1997）随后使用轴对称版本来检查气泡和液滴的行为。与VOF方法不同，其中不连续标记函数与流平行，在Level-Set方法中使用连续的级别集函数。然后用界面功能的零轮廓识别界面。为了重建流动的材料性质（例如，密度和粘度），从水平仪函数构建标记函数。标记函数给出从一个流体到下一个流体的平滑过渡区域，从而通过VOF方法增加界面的规则性，其中界面仅限于一个网格空间。然而，从水平集函数到标记函数的映射需要水平集函数在界面附近保持相同的形状并处理这个问题，Sussman等人（1994）引入了一种重新初始化过程，其中调整水平集函数的方式是使其值等于到达界面的最短距离。这一步对于使液位工作用于流体动力学模拟至关重要。表面张力的发现方式与Brackbill等人为VOF方法引入的连续表面力技术相同。 （1992年）。 Level-Set方法的早期实施并没有很好地保存质量，并且在原始介绍之后进行了一些改进和扩展。 Sussman等人（1998）和Sussman和Fatemi（1999）介绍了改进质量保护的方法，Sussman et al。 （1999），Sussman和Puckett（2000）开发了自适应网格细化和混合VOF / Level-Set方法的水平集跟踪。

### CIP
The Constrained Interpolated Propagation (CIP) method introduced by Takewaki et al. (1985) has been particularly popular with Japanese authors who have applied it to a wide variety of multiphase problems. In the CIP method the transition from one fluid to another is described by a cubic polynomial. Both the marker function and its derivative are then updated to advect the interface. In addition to simulating two-fluid problems, the method has been used for a number of more complex applications, such as those involving floating solids, see Yabe et al. (2001).   
由Takewaki等人介绍的约束内插传播（CIP）方法（1985）已被日本作家特别欢迎，并将其应用于各种各样的多相问题。在CIP方法中，通过三次多项式描述从一种流体到另一种流体的过渡。标记功能及其衍生物随后被更新以平滑接口。除了模拟双流体问题之外，该方法已经用于许多更复杂的应用，例如涉及浮动固体的应用，参见Yabe等人（2001年）。

In the Phase-Field method the governing equations are modified in such a way that the dynamics of the smoothed region between the different fluids is described in a thermodynamically consistent way. In actual implementations the thickness of the transition is, however, much larger than it is in real systems and the net effect of the modification is to provide an “antidiffusive” term that keeps the interface reasonably sharp. While superficially there are considerable similarities between Phase-Field and Level-Set methods, the fundamental ideas behind the methods are very different. In the Level- Set method the smoothness of the phase boundary is completely artificial and introduced for numerical reasons only. In Phase-Field methods, on the other hand, the transition zone is real, although it is made much thicker than it should be for numerical reasons. It is not clear, at the time of this writing, whether keeping the correct thermodynamic conditions in an artificially thick interface has any advantages over methods that start with a completely sharp interface. The key drawback seems to be that since the propagation and properties of the interface depend sensitively on the dynamics in the transition zone, it must be well resolved. For the motion of two immiscible fluids, that are well described by assuming a sharp interface, this adds a resolution requirement that is more stringent than for other “one-fluid” methods. The phase-field approach was originally introduced to model solidification (see Kobayashi, 1992, 1993) and has found widespread use in such simulations. With the exception of the modeling of solidification in the presence of flows (Beckermann et al., 1999; Tonhardt and Amberg, 1998), its use for fluid dynamic simulations is relatively limited (Jacqmin, 1999; Jamet et al., 2001). The main appeal of the Phase-Field methods appears to be for problems where small-scale physics must be accounted for and it is difficult to do so in the sharp interface limit.    
在相场方法中，控制方程被修改为使得不同流体之间的平滑区域的动力学以热力学一致的方式被描述。然而，在实际实现中，过渡的厚度远大于实际系统的厚度，而修改的净效果是提供一种“防扩散”术语，以保持界面相当锐利。虽然表面上相位和层次方法之间存在很大的相似之处，但是方法背后的基本思想是截然不同的。在Level-Set方法中，相位的平滑度是完全人为的，仅在数值上被引入。另一方面，在Phase-Field方法中，过渡区域是实际的，尽管它比数值原因要厚得多。在撰写本文时，不清楚在人为厚的界面中保持正确的热力学条件是否比以完全清晰的界面开始的方法有优势。关键的缺点似乎是，由于界面的传播和性质敏感地依赖于过渡区域的动力学，因此必须很好地解决。对于两种不混溶的流体的运动，通过假设一个清晰的界面可以很好地描述，这增加了比其他“单流体”方法更严格的分辨率要求。最初引入相场方法来模拟凝固（参见Kobayashi，1992，1993），并且已经在这种模拟中被广泛使用。除了在流动存在下凝固的建模之外（Beckermann等，1999; Tonhardt和Amberg，1998），其用于流体动力学模拟的用途相对有限（Jacqmin，1999; Jamet等，2001）。相位方法的主要吸引力似乎是解决小规模物理学问题，而在界面极限界限上难以做到这一点。

In the “one-fluid” methods described above, where a single set of govern- ing equations is used to describe the fluid motion in both fluids, the fluid motion is computed on regular structured grids and the main difference be- tween the various methods is how a marker function is advected (and how surface tension is found). The thickness of the interface varies from one cell in VOF methods to a few cells in Level-Set and Front-Tracking methods, but once the marker function has been found, the specific scheme for the interface advection is essentially irrelevant for the rest of the computations. While these methods have been enormously successful, their ac- curacy is generally somewhat limited. There have therefore recently been several attempts to generate methods that retain most of the advantages of these methods but treat the interface as “fully sharp.” The origin of these attempts can be traced to the work of Glimm and collaborators (Glimm et al., 1981; Glimm and McBryan, 1985; Chern et al., 1986), who used grids that were modified locally near an interface in such a way that the interface coincided with a cell boundary, and more recent “cut-cell” methods for the inclusion of complex bodies in simulations of inviscid flows (Quirk, 1994; Powell, 1998). In their modern incarnation, sharp interface methods include the Ghost Fluid method, the Immersed-Interface method and the method of Udaykumar et al. (2001). In the “ghost fluid” method introduced by Fedkiw et al. (1999) the interface is marked by advecting a level-set function, but to find numerical approximations to derivatives near the interface, where the finite difference stencil involves values from the other side of the interface, fictitious values are assigned to those grid points. The values are obtained by extrapolation and a few different possibilities for doing so are discussed by Glimm et al. (2001), for example. The “Immersed-Interface” method of Lee and LeVeque (2003) is, on the other hand, based on modifying the numerical approximations near the interface by explicitly incorporating the jump across the interface into the finite difference equations. While this is easily done for relatively simple jump conditions, it becomes more involved for complex situations. Lee and LeVeque (2003) thus found it necessary to limit their development to fluids with the same viscosity. In the method of Udaykumar et al. (2001) complex solid boundaries are represented on a regular grid by merging cells near the interface and using polynomial fitting to find field values at the interface. This method, which is related to the “cut-cell” methods used for inviscid compressible flows (Powell, 1998) has so far only been implemented for solids and fluids, including solidification (Yang and Udaykumar, 2005), but there seems to be no reason why the method can not be used for multifluid problems. For an extension to three dimensions, see Marella et al. (2005).
While the original “one-fluid” methods require essentially no modification of the flow solver near the interface (except allowing for variable density and viscosity), the sharp interface methods all require localized modifications of the basic scheme. This results in considerably more complex numerical schemes, but is also likely to improve the accuracy. That may be important for extreme values of the governing parameters, such as large differences be- tween the material properties of the different fluids and low viscosities. The sharp interface approach may also be required for flows with very complex interface physics. However, methods based on a straightforward implementation of the “one-fluid” formulation of the governing equations, coupled with advanced schemes to advect the interface (or marker function) have already demonstrated their usefulness for a large range of problems and it is likely that their simplicity will ensure that they will continue to be widely used.
在上述“单流体”方法中，使用一组控制方程来描述两种流体中的流体运动，流体运动是在规则的网格上计算的，并且各种方法之间的主要差异标记功能是如何平坦的（以及如何发现表面张力）。接口的厚度从VOF方法中的一个单元格变为Level-Set和Front-Tracking方法中的几个单元格，但是一旦找到了标记函数，界面对流的具体方案与其余部分基本无关计算。虽然这些方法已经取得了巨大的成功，但它们的精确度一般有限。因此，最近有几种尝试产生保留这些方法的大部分优点的方法，但将界面视为“完全清晰”。这些尝试的起源可以追溯到Glimm和合作者的工作（Glimm等人， 1981; Glimm和McBryan，1985; Chern等人，1986），他们使用在界面附近被修改的网格，使得界面与单元格边界一致，并且更新的“切割单元”方法将复杂体包含在模拟无粘性流中（Quirk，1994; Powell，1998）。在他们现代的化身中，尖锐的界面方法包括Ghost Fluid方法，Immersed-Interface方法和Udaykumar等人的方法。 （2001年）。在Fedkiw等人介绍的“鬼流体”方法中（1999）的界面标记为平流水平集函数，但为了在界面附近找到导数附近的数值近似，其中有限差分模板涉及界面另一侧的值，虚拟值被分配给这些网格点。这些值是通过外推获得的，并且这样做的几个不同的可能性由Glimm等人讨论（2001）。另一方面，Lee和LeVeque（2003）的“Immersed-Interface”方法是通过将界面上的跳跃明确地并入到有限差分方程中来修改界面附近的数值近似。虽然这对于相对简单的跳转条件来说很容易实现，但是对于复杂的情况而言，它变得更加复杂。 Lee和LeVeque（2003）认为有必要将它们的发展限制在具有相同粘度的流体中。在Udaykumar等人的方法中（2001）复杂的实体边界通过在接口附近合并单元格并使用多项式拟合来在规则网格上表示以在界面处找到字段值。这种与用于非粘性可压缩流动的“切细胞”方法有关的方法（Powell，1998）迄今为止，仅用于固体和流体，包括凝固（Yang和Udaykumar，2005），但似乎有没有理由为什么该方法不能用于多流体问题。要扩展到三维，请参阅Marella等人（2005年）。
虽然原始的“单流体”方法基本上不需要界面附近的流动求解器的修改（除了允许变化的密度和粘度），但是尖锐的界面方法都需要基本方案的局部修改。这导致相当复杂的数值方案，但也可能提高精度。这对于控制参数的极值可能是重要的，例如不同流体的材料性质和低粘度之间的很大差异。对于具有非常复杂的界面物理学的流，也可能需要尖锐的界面方法。然而，基于直接实施控制方程式的“单流体”方案的方法，加上先进的方案来平缓接口（或标记功能）已经证明了它们对大范围问题的有用性，并且很可能它们的简单性将确保它们将继续被广泛使用。

## Looking Ahead 
Direct numerical simulations of multiphase flows have come a long way in the last decade and a half or so. It is now possible to simulate accurately the evolution of disperse flows of several hundred bubbles, droplets and particles for sufficiently long times so that reliable values can be obtained for various statistical quantities. Similarly, major progress has been achieved in the development of methods for more complex flows, including those where a liquid solidifies or evaporates. Simulations of large systems undergoing boiling and solidification are therefore within reach. 
Much remains to be done, however, and it is probably fair to say that the use of direct numerical simulations of multiphase flows for research and design is still in the embryonic state. The possibility of computing the evolution of complex multiphase flows—such as churn-turbulent bubbly flow undergoing boiling, or the breakup of a jet into evaporating droplets—will transform our understanding of flows of enormous economic significance. Currently, control of most multiphase flow processes is fairly rudimentary and almost exclusively based on intuition and empirical observations. Industries that deal primarily with multiphase flows are, however, multibillion dollar operations and the savings realized if atomizers for spray generation, bubble injectors in bubble columns and inserts into pipes to break up droplets, just to name a few examples, could be improved by just a little bit would add up to a substantial amount of money. Reliable predictions would also reduce the design cost significantly for situations such as space vehicles and habitats where experimental investigations are expensive. And, as the possibilities of manipulating flows at the very smallest scales by either stationary or free flowing MEMS devices become more realistic, the need to predict the effect of such manipulations becomes critical.    
在过去的十年半左右，多相流的直接数值模拟已经有很长的路要走。现在可以准确地模拟几百个气泡，液滴和颗粒的分散流的进行足够长的时间，从而可以获得各种统计量的可靠值。类似地，在开发更复杂流动的方法方面取得了重大进展，包括液体固化或蒸发的方法。因此，正在进行沸腾和凝固的大型系统的模拟是可以接近的。
然而，还有许多工作要做，可以公平地说，使用用于研究和设计的多相流的直接数值模拟仍处于初始状态。计算复杂多相流的演化的可能性，如流经沸腾的搅动湍流气泡，或将喷射分解成蒸发液滴，将会改变我们对具有巨大经济意义的流动的理解。目前，大多数多相流过程的控制是相当初步的，几乎完全基于直觉和经验观察。然而，主要处理多相流的行业是数十亿美元的操作，如果喷雾生成的雾化器，气泡塔中的气泡注入器和插入管道以分解液滴，仅仅举出几个例子，则可以实现节约有点会增加大量的钱。对于实验调查费用较高的航天器和栖息地等情况，可靠的预测也将大大降低设计成本。并且，由于通过静止或自由流动的MEMS器件在非常小的尺度上操纵流动的可能性变得更加现实，所以预测这种操作的影响的需要变得至关重要。

While speculating about the long term impact of any new technology is a dangerous thing—and we will simply state that the impact of direct numerical simulations of multiphase flows will without doubt be significant—it is easier to predict the near future. Apart from the obvious prediction that computers will continue to become faster and more available, we expect that the development of numerical methods will focus mainly on flows with complex physics. Although some progress has already been achieved for flows with variable surface tension, flows coupled to temperature and electric fields and flows with phase change, simulations of such systems are still far from being commonplace. In addition to the need to solve a large number of equations, coupled systems generally possess much larger ranges of length and time scales than simple two-fluid systems. Thus, the incorporation of implicit time-integrators for stiff systems and adaptive gridding will become even more important. It is also likely, as more and more complex problems are dealt with, that the differences between direct numerical simulations—where everything is resolved fully—and simulations where the smallest scales are modeled will become blurred. Simulations of atomization where the evolution of thin films are computed by “subgrid” models and very small droplets are included as point particles are relatively obvious examples of such simulations (for a discussion of the point-particle approximation see Chapter 9 in Prosperetti and Tryggvason, 2007, for example). Other examples include possible couplings of continuum approaches as those described in this Book with microscopic simulations of moving contact lines, kinetics effects at a solidifying interface, and reactions in thin flames. Simulations of non-Newtonian fluids, where the microstructure has to be modeled in such a way that the molecular structure is accounted for in some way, also fall under this category. 
In addition to the development of more powerful numerical methods, it is increasingly critical to deal with the “human” aspect of large-scale numerical simulations. The physical problems that we must deal with and the computational tools that are available are rapidly becoming very complex. The difficulty of developing fully parallelized software to solve the continuum equations (fluid flow, mass and heat transfer, etc), where three-dimensional interfaces must be handled and the grids must be dynamically adapted, are putting such simulations beyond the reach of a single graduate student. In the future these simulations may even be beyond the capacity of small re- search groups. It is becoming very difficult for a graduate student to learn everything that he or she needs to know and make significant new progress in four to five years. Lowering the “knowledge barrier” and ensuring that new investigators can enter the field of direct numerical simulations of multiphase flow may well become as important as improving the efficiency and accuracy of the numerical methods. The present book is an attempt to ease the entry of new researchers into this field.    
虽然推测任何新技术的长期影响是一件危险的事情 - 我们将简单地说明，直接数值模拟多相流的影响无疑将是重要的 - 更容易预测近期。除了显而易见的预测，电脑将继续变得更快更可用，我们预计数值方法的发展将主要集中在具有复杂物理学的流动。尽管对于具有可变表面张力的流动已经取得了一些进展，但是伴随着温度和电场的流动以及相变的流动，这种系统的模拟仍然远非常见。除了需要解决大量方程之外，耦合系统通常具有比简单的双流体系统更大的长度和时间范围。因此，为僵硬系统和自适应网格化引入隐式时间积分器将变得更加重要。随着越来越复杂的问题得到解决，也可能是直接数值模拟之间的差异 - 其中一切都被完全解决，而模拟最小尺度的模拟将变得模糊。通过“子网格”模型和非常小的液滴计算薄膜的演化的模拟，作为点粒子是包含这些模拟的相对明显的例子（关于点粒子近似的讨论参见Prosperetti和Tryggvason的第9章，例如2007）。其他实例包括连续方法的可能耦合，如本书中所描述的，具有移动接触线的微观模拟，凝固界面处的动力学效应和薄焰中的反应。非牛顿流体的模拟，其中微结构必须以某种方式对分子结构进行建模的模型也属于这一类。
除了开发更强大的数值方法外，处理大规模数值模拟的“人”方面也越来越重要。我们必须处理的物理问题和可用的计算工具正在迅速变得非常复杂。开发完全并行化软件来解决必须处理三维接口和网格必须动态调整的连续方程（流体流动，质量和热传递等）的困难在于将这种模拟超出单个范围研究生。在将来这些模拟甚至可能超出了小型研究组的能力。研究生变得很难学习他或她需要知道的一切，并在四到五年内取得重大进展。降低“知识壁垒”，确保新的调查人员能够进入多相流的直接数值模拟领域，与提高数值方法的效率和准确性一样重要。本书是为了缓解新研究人员进入这个领域的一个尝试。
