We first derive the **equations for flows without interfaces**, in a relatively standard manner.    
Then we discuss the **mathematical representation of a moving interface** and the appropriate **jump conditions** needed to couple the equations across the interfaces.    
Finally, we introduce the so-called **“one-fluid” approach** where the interface is introduced as **a singular distribution** in equations written for the whole flow field. The “one-fluid” form of the equations plays a fundamental role for the numerical methods discussed in the rest of the book.
