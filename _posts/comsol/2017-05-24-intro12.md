What is the importance of eigenvalues-eigenvectors

## Short Answer
Eigenvectors make understanding linear transformations easy. They are the "axes" (directions) along which a **linear transformation** acts simply by "stretching/compressing" and/or "flipping"; eigenvalues give you the factors by which this compression occurs.

The more directions you have along which you understand the behavior of a linear transformation, the easier it is to understand the linear transformation; so you want to have as many linearly independent eigenvectors as possible associated to a single linear transformation.

## Slightly Longer Answer
There are a lot of problems that can be modeled with linear transformations, and the eigenvectors give very simply solutions. For example, consider the system of linear differential equations

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= ax + by\\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= cx + dy.
\end{align*}
$$

That is the essence of what one hopes to do with the eigenvectors and eigenvalues: **"decouple" the ways in which the linear transformation acts into a number of independent actions along separate "directions", that can be dealt with independently.** A lot of problems come down to figuring out these "lines of independent action", and understanding them can really help you figure out what the matrix/linear transformation is "really" doing.
