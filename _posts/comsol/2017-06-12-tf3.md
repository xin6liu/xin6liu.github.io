To advance the interface: Given a velocity field, u  
The evolution equation becomes 

∂φ / ∂t + u ⋅ ∇φ = 0  

Interfacial geometric quantities can be easily calculated using φ 
n=∇φ |∇φ|,κ=∇⋅n 

difficulties: not conservative  
loss or gain of mass (area) due to numerical diffusion 

下面是书里一段简介：
> The **Volume-of-Fluid (VOF)** method is the oldest method to advect a marker function and—after many improvements and innovations—continues to be widely used. Other marker function methods include the **Level-Set** method, the **Phase-Field** method, and the **CIP** method. Instead of advecting the marker function directly, the **boundary** between the different fluids can also be tracked using marker points, and the **marker function** then **reconstructed from the location of the interface**. Methods using **marker points** are generally referred to as “**front-tracking**” methods to distinguish them from “**front-capturing**” methods were the **marker function is advected directly**. 

The two main approaches to characterize moving interfaces are interface tracking (Eulerian) and interface capturing (Lagrangian) techniques.

这里我们讨论的是 Level Set 和 Phase Field 方法：
Level Set and Phase Field methods are well-known **interface-capturing** techniques for approximation of moving interfaces. 

第一部分：
a recently developed *sharp-interface phase-field method* [1]() is implemented in Matlab and used to implicitly capture **normal interface motion** and **interface advection** by an **external velocity field**. The **interface evolution equation** is solved numerically using an **explicit finite difference scheme**. 

第二部分：
a *conservative level set method*, introduced by Olsson and Kreiss [2](), is used for simulation of incompressible two-phase flows. Several two-phase test-cases are considered, including **rising bubble and falling droplet**. Differences between the current methods and the original level set method are highlighted.
