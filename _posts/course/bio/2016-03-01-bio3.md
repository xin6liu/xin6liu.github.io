##4.1 general aspects of protein structure
be folded into coils, zigzags, turns, loops.
native conformation
?? size: 50-9000 aa/pp  (aa=amino acid,  pp=polypeptide )
?? average MW of aa = 110 da 
?? MW pp = 5500 -> 1000000 da
protein can consist of more than 1 pp chain, joined by disulfide bridges and/or non-covalent forces
classification of proteins
>1. by shape:
globular proteins -soluble;  fibrous proteins -insoluble.
2. by function:
enzyme, transport, contractile, structural, defense, regulatory.
3. by prosthetic group  (apoprotein + prosthetic group = holoprotein)
glycoprotein, lipoprotein, nucleoprotein, metalloprotein, heme protein.
Four levels of structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary.

##4.2 methods for determine protein structure
x-ray crystallography
the determination of protein structures is now limited mainly by the difficulty of preparing crystals of a quality suitable for X-ray diffraction. 
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
don’t need crystals, dynamic, aqueous environment; but intrinsic insensitivity

##4.3 three-dimensional structure of protein
4.3.1 the conformation of the peptide group
resonance structure
rotation angle N-C\alpha -> \phi
C\alpha-C -> \psi
peptide bond angle -> \omega
Gly has the greatest conformational freedom because it lacks a \beta-carbon
4.3.2 secondary structure of protein
(a) \alpha-helix
(b) \beta-sheet
(c) \beta-turn
(d) \Omega-loops
(e) random coil
