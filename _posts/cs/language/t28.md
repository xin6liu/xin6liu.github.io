# SAT 
 
A formula is satisfiable when at least one interpretation (an assignment of true and false values to logical variables) leads to the formula evaluating to true. 
If no such interpretation exists, the formula is unsatisfiable.

至少有一种 interpretation(assignment) 使得这个 formula 为 true，那么这个 formula 就是satisfiable.

DIMACS:
1. A comment line. Any line that starts with "c" is comment line.
2. A summary line. This line contains information about the kind and size of the problem within the file. A summary line starts with "p", continues with the kind of the problem (in most cases "cnf"), the number of variables and the number of clauses within this problem. Some DIMACS parsers expect this line to be the first non-comment line, but some parsers can handle the file without it.
3. A clause line. A clause line consists of space-separated numbers, ending with a 0. Each non-zero number denotes a literal, with negative numbers being negative literals of that variable, and 0 being the terminator of a line.

As an example, this formula

would be converted into DIMACS as
