tonight I can write

文/聂鲁达

Tonight i can write the saddest lines

今夜我可以写下最哀伤的诗句

Write,for example,"the night ie shattered and blue stars shiver in the distance.

写,譬如,"夜色零落,蓝色的星光在远方颤抖."

The night wind revolves in the sky and sings

夜风在天空中回旋吟唱

Tonight i can write the saddest lines

今夜我可以写下最哀伤的诗句

And i loved her,and sometimes she loved me too

我爱过她,而且有时她也爱我

Through nights like this one i held her in my arms

多少个如今的晚上,我曾拥她入怀

I kissed her again and again under the endless sky

在无垠的天空下一遍又一遍的吻她

She loved me and sometimes i loved her too

她爱过我,有时我也爱她

How could one not have loved her great still eyes

我怎么能不爱上她那一双沉静的双眼

Tonight i can write the saddest lines

今夜我可以写下最哀伤的诗句

To think that i do not have her,to feel that i have lost her

我不再拥有她,因为我已失去她

To hear the immense night,still moer immense without her

聆听广阔的夜空,因为没有她而更加广阔

And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture

而诗句坠在灵魂上,如同露水坠在牧草上
