## Part1: Introduction

nanotechnology sciences 包含的四门学科：
> Chem.; Phy.; Mat. science; Engineering

Definition: 
> NANOTECHNOLOGY is the production and application of structures, devices and systems by controlling shape and size at nanometre scales.

Applications: nanoparticels.
> single magnetic domain: magnetic recording
smaller than wavelength of light: colored glass
dye-sensitized: solar cell

> properties and future applications: 10-14

> Why important?
On the nanoscale, quantum mechanical effects become significant, and thus by changing the structure of a material, we can change things like charge capacity, magnetization, melting point, etc., without changing the chemical composition.
self assembly, extremely high surface area-to-volume ratios, better packing efficiency.

> fields:
nano materials,
nano electronics
nano electromechanical systems (NEM)
nano biology and anno medicine

> material properties

> Physics on the Nanoscale
electromagnetic forces, wave-particle duality, quantum mechanical tunneling, quantization of energy, random molecular motion

> chemistry on the nanoscale
intramolecular bonding: ionic, covalent, metallic
intermolecular bonding: ion-ion, ion-duple, can der Waals, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions
surface-area to volume ratio -\> surface energy -\> decrease in melting point, increase in heat capacity

> colors and quantum dots
Oscillations in the surface electrons of the nanoparticles cause absorption at particular wavelengths, precisely dependent on size.

## Part2: Mat. synthesis
三种方法：

Strategies:
Top-Down:  etching, patterning; attrition, slicing, milling; difficult to control nanoscale

thermal: annealing; evaporation; sublimation; combustion
high energy: arc discharge(cnts); laser ablation; combustion
chemical: chemical etching; polishing; combustion
natural: erosion; etching(acids); digestion

Bottom-Up
Gas phase: CVD; atomic layer deposition; epitaxial growth methods
Liquid phase: molecular self-assembly; sol-gel processes; electrodeposition; anodising
Biological: protein synthesis; nucleic acid synthesis; membrane synthesis

cnt synthesis: arc discharge; chemical vapor deposition; laser ablation; hydrocarbon flames

wet and soft chemistry methods:
flame synthesis; hydrothermal; sol-gel; electrochemical deposition

hydrothermal synthesis: high T and P, critical point, chemical activity, different states/phases
nano forests: Polymer removal and seed NPs for branched growth

sol-gel synthesis:
sol: van der Waals forces or H-bonds
gel: covalent
sol-gel process: polycondensation reactions(缩聚反应)
solution of precursors -\> [condensation] -\> Sol -\> [gelation凝胶化] -\> Gel -\> [supercritical drying] -\> aerogel

electrochemical deposition:
making thin films, based on reduction-oxidation reactions, require conductive substrates

General strategies: templates; seed layers (diamond); catalysis.

Dry Chemistry Methods:
overview:  precursor, vapor phase, substrate, condense, nucleate and grow

film growth modes:
layer by layer: film bound to substrate;
island growth: film bound to each other;
mixed growth: initially layer-by-layer then island growth;
reactive intermixing: film and substrate and difficult to distinguish.

types of films:
epitaxial: single crystalline, no grain boundaries, layer-by-layer, high temperature;
polycrystalline: island or mixed-growth, lots of grain boundaries;
amorphous: island or mixed-growth, no crystalline structure.

CVD:
steps: transport gaseous reactants to the substrate; reactants get absorbed onto the substrate; reactions occur at the substrate, promoted by heat; by-products are carried away.

## Part3: Structure determination
overview:
light microscopy (resolution is limited); electron microscopy (sample preparation requirements are limited); scanning probe microscopy ( 3D imaging, no sample damage, but is limited to flat surfaces sometimes only conductive surfaces for special modes)

x-rays diffraction:
used to determine crystal structure, spectrum from XRD is used to determine the presence of phases, size and defects.

lens:
focal length 1/f = 1/u + 1/v
magnification M = -v/u = -di/do
Snell’s Law

illumination source; condenser lens; sample; objective lens; eyepiece lens
transmitted illumination: high energy, dark field imaging
reflected illumination: low energy

Numerical Aperture: NA = n sin\theta
N = f/D = 1/2NA
Depth of field: DOF \~ \lambda / NA : large aperture -\> narrow depth of focus
resolution limit: \lambda / 2NA

Dark field imaging: collect only light scattered by the sample. Best for more transparent samples, but high illumination needed.

 Fluorescence microscopy: some molecules absorb and emit light at different wavelengths.
stokes shift, lower energy, longer \lambda, blue -\> green.

confocal microscopy: dichroic mirror, confocal pinhole

Polarized light microscopy, phase contrast light microscopy, differential interference contrast microscopy

Electron Microscopy
comparison:

波长短，n变小（glass-\>vacuum），resolution短，large DOF
波长与V (the acceleration voltage of the electrons) 成反比
relativistic effects 使波长变短电子质量增加
透射电子显微镜TEM（样本必须非常薄）
扫描电子显微镜SEM（有立体感）(可配套WDX波谱仪 ,EDX能谱仪）

imaging mode: intermediate lens focuses on the first intermediate image plane.
diffraction mode: intermediate lens focuses on the back focal plane. First intermediate image is used for “selected area electron diffraction”.

TEM: sample preparation (thinly sliced), sampling (region is tiny), projection (2D), damage.
SEM: because of scattering effects, information other than morphology can be obtained.

Electron-Matter Interactions
Secondary electrons (SE): surface, inelastic scattering(少数,波长改变), topographical image
Back-Scattered electrons (BSE): deeper, elastic scattering, reflection, composition
Characteristic X-rays: 伴随着SE, 高能级到低能级fill the gap释放
Auger Electrons: 跟Characteristic X-rays相似，但前者测thickness atomic composition, Auger 测surface

low-energy electrons -\> detailed images
edges brighter because more SE

透射电子显微镜TEM（样本必须非常薄）
扫描电子显微镜SEM（有立体感）(可配套WDX波谱仪 ,EDX能谱仪）
扫描探针显微镜SPM（工作环境不苛刻）
扫描隧道显微镜STM（隧道效应，必须是导电样品）

Scanning Probe Microscopy
tip-based microscopy, piezoelectric materials

STM:
tunneling current is so sensitive to distance
negative sample bias -\> e- to tip -\> filled state imaging
positive sample bias -\> e- to sample -\> empty state imaging
constant height mode, constant current mode
advantages: high resolution, limited primarily by the sharpness of the tip; extreme surface sensitivity
disadvantages: conductive; sensitive to any contaminants; low coverage;

AFM:
forces between tip and sample:
long range: electrostatic forces, van der Waals forces
short range: hydrogen bonding, contact forces
先long range van der Waals interaction吸引, 后short range coulomb interaction排斥。
soft cantilevers, contact mode, k f 小
stiffer cantilevers, non contact/tapping mode, k f 大
hard samples, static
softer or delicate samples, dynamic
non contact/intermittent contact(tapping) mode: force changes, amplitude changes. cantilever maintains a constant height above the sample. repulsive force-\> increased resonant frequency.

KPFM:
not topography but electrical surface potential.
capacitor
amplitude is sensitive to the force, frequency is sensitive to force gradient, higher resolution than AM.
A typical procedure captures the AFM signals (height, phase) in one pass, then KPFM in a second pass, continuing down the sample one line at a time. Thus both signals are generated at the same time.
