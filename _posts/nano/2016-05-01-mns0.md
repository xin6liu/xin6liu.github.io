[1. Nano materials]
====================

### 纳米材料特殊性质举例
>materials in nano size range exhibit some remarkable specific properties, for example:
1.Crystals in the nanometer scale have a low melting point and reduced lattice constants.
2.Bulk semiconductors become insulators when the characteristic dimension is sufficiently small.

### 纳米材料举例
>Nanostructure materials are those with at least one dimension falling in nanometer scale, and include:
nanoparticles, nano rods and nanowire, thin films, bulk materials made of nanoscale building blocks or consisting of nanoscale structures.

### 纳米材料分类
>Classification of NSMs (nanostructured materials)
zero-dimensional(0-D), 0 dimension is not confined to the nanoscale range (<100nm)./ all dimensions are confined… {nanoparticles}
1-D, {nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes}
2-D, {nano coatings and nanofilms}
3-D, {dispersions of nanoparticles, bundles of nanowires and nanotubes, multinanolayers}
1.matrix-reinforced nano composites: matrix reinforced with nanoparticles, matrix reinforced with nanowires/nanotubes
2.layered nano composites: laminates, sandwiches

### carbon
>diamond: sp3; graphite: sp2
0D: fullerenes; 1D: carbon nanotubes; 2D: graphene; 3D: graphite

### Surface energy
>for a given surface with a fixed surface area, the surface energy can be reduced through: 1. surface relaxation; 2. surface restructuring; 3. surface adsorption; 4. composition segregation.
Therefore, a crystalline particle normally forms facets, instead of having a spherical shape. (reduction of the overall  surface area)

### Chemical potential
>![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Delta \mu = \gamma \Omega (1/R_1 + 1/R_2)) convex surface, the curvature is positive, chemical potential of an atom is higher than that on a flat surface. (concave is lower than flat)
