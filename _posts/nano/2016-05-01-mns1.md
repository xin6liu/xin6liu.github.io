##五种材料的拼写要记住
>metal alloy
>ceramics  and glass
>polymer
>semiconductor
>composite materials

##释意
>composition: the chemical make-up of a material.
structure: the arrangement of atoms
synthesis: how materials are made from naturally occurring or man-made chemicals.
processing: how materials are shaped into useful component. 
microstructure: the structure in the 0.1~100
micrometer level.

##区别
>Materials engineers focus on how to translate or transform materials into useful devices or structures.

>metals and alloys: 
electrical and thermal conductivity
high strength and stiffness

>ceramics:
high MP, poor electrical and thermal conductivity— insulator
high compressive strength but brittle

>crystalline materials have long-range order arrangement of its atoms while amorphous materials have short-range order.
crystalline: metal
amorphous: glass

>crystalline materials will produce diffraction patterns while amorphous materials will not.

##选材
>For example, silicon carbide particles could be introduced into pure aluminum; the silicon carbide particles provide wear resistance while aluminum provides conductivity.
