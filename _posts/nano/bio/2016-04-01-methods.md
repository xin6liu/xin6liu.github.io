##1. Kjeldahl Method: 
This method determines total nitrogen in protein to find out total concentration of protein. protein% = N * 6.25

##2. Biuret Method: 
Using the reaction of biuret and CuSO4 to form purple complex and find out concentration by comparing A540 with standard curve.

##3. Folin Method: 
Based on Buret method, add Folin to enhance the color and sensitiveness of detection of protein.

##4. Absorbance at 280nm: 
Protein absorbs strongly at 280 nm due to a number of its constituent aromatic amino acids, tryptophan, tyrosine.

##5. BCA:  
The total protein concentration is exhibited by a color change of the sample solution from green to purple in proportion to protein concentration, which can then be measured using colorimetric techniques.

##6. Bradford Assay: 
Bradford Assay is a rapid and accurate method commonly used to determine the total protein concentration of a sample.

##7. ELISA: 
enzyme-linked immunoab sorbent assay requires the generation of antibodies. It uses the immune-technology which can detect target-specific protein concentration.
