Ceramics exhibit good strength under compression; however, they exhibit virtually no ductility under tension.

Ceramics家族包括polycrystalline and single-crystal **inorganic materials**, **inorganic glasses**, and **glass-ceramics**.

## Classification
一般我们不以chemical compounds分类，而是以major function分类。
* electrical 
* magnetic
* optical 
* automotive
* mechanical/structural
* biomedical
* construction
* others
* chemical
* domestic

## Structure
有amorphous但主要是crystalline:
* Sodium chloride
* Diamond cubic
* Cubic zincblende(ZnS) (sphalerite)
* Fluorite(CaF2)
* Hexagonal zincblende(ZnS) (wurtzite) 

## Applications (重点)
* Alumina (Al2O3)
* Diamond (C)
* Silica (SiO2)
* Silicon carbide (SiC)
* Silicon nitride (Si3N4)
* Titanium dioxide (TiO2)
* Zirconia (ZrO2)

## Bonding
Ceramics由primary bonds组成，这些bonds主要是ionic or covalent还有少量的metallic bonding.
A large amount of thermal energy must be provided to cause atoms or ions to separate to larger interatomic or interionic distances, thereby leading to melting.
**High melting point materials also tend to have high elastic moduli (弹性模量), meaning that the bonds are stiff (high stiffness).**
Materials that have predominantly ionic or covalent bonds lack free electrons to conduct electricity.所以它是good thermal insulators.
例外就是diamond, since diamond has extraordinarily stiff bonds that efficiently transport heat.
