## Summary 
A finite element method based on a phase-field model for two-phase flow is proposed. The models consist of a Navier-Stokes system coupled with a multi-component Cahn-Hillard system. The Cahn–Hilliard equation [1] is used to estimate interface of the two different phases in the PFM. In particular, a detailed explanation for solving the Cahn–Hilliard equation by using a finite element method is given. 

There are two steps in this project. 

* First, we deal with the basic one phase problem. We calculate the weak form of Naiver-stokes equation, and compute it using finite element method in FEniCS [2], which is a popular open-source python computing platform for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). 

* Second, we go through the two phase flow. We impose capillary tensor in the Naiver-stokes equation, and calculate its weak form. Then compute it using finite element method in FEniCS.

If the project were successful, different flow regimes can be applied like Bubbly flow, Droplet flow, Particle-laden flow, Free-surface flow, and Fluidized beds. Then the graphs of these different flow regimes can be drawn by Python code.

## Background and Problem Statement 

The two-phase flow is involved in many important industrial problems. For example, nuclear reactors use water to remove heat from the reactor core using two-phase flow. Two-phase flows are challenging to study from mathematical modeling and numerical algorithmic points of view.

For mathematical modeling, there are two main approaches to simulating two-phase flow: interface tracking and interface capturing methods. In interface tracking methods (volume-of-fluid, front-tracking, and immersed boundary), Lagrangian particles are used to track the interfaces and are advected by the velocity field. In interface capturing methods (level-set and phase-field methods), the interface is implicitly captured by a contour of a particular scalar function.

For numerical algorithm to compute Navier-Stockes equation, there are finite difference method, finite volume method, and finite element method.

The interface function of the VOF (volume-of-fluid) method is discontinuous at the interface of the liquid and gaseous phases. On the other hand, the interface function of the PFM (phase-field method) varies continuously or smoothly in the vicinity of the interface of the liquid and gaseous phases. In terms of numerical stability, it is more advantageous to solve a function that is continuous at an interface rather than a function that is discontinuous at the interface. Therefore, in this project, we will use phase field method and finite element method.

## Proposed Solution and Concepts 
There are generally four objective in this project:

1. Finite element method Python code for general Naiver-Stokes equation.
2. Imposing capillary tensor in the Naiver-stokes equation, and calculate its weak form.
3. Deducing the Cahn–Hilliard equation.
4. Solving the Cahn–Hilliard equation by using a finite element method.

First, we will solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. There are many difficulties: time-dependence, nonlinearity, and vector-valued variables. Second- order splitting method is applied for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, can be implemented with relative ease in FEniCS. 

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations form a system of equations for the velocity u and pressure p in an incompressible fluid: 

$$ \rho (\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - u \cdot \nabla u) = \nabla \cdot T(u,p) + f $$

$$ \nabla \cdot u = 0$$

The right-hand side f is a given force per unit volume and just as for the equations of linear elasticity, T(u,p) denotes the stress tensor, which for a Newtonian fluid is given by 

$$ T(u,p) = 2\mu D(u) - p \delta $$

where D(u) is the strain-rate tensor:

$$ D(u) = \frac12 (\nabla u + \nabla u ^T)$$

The parameter $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. 

To get the Variational formulation, incremental pressure correction scheme (IPCS) is applied. First, we computed the tentative velocity $u^\*$ based on the pressure from the previous time step. Then use the computed tentative velocity to compute the new pressure $p^n$. Finally, compute the corrected velocity $u^{n+1}$. 

Then we can plot the velocity profile at the final time for the Navier–Stokes channel flow using IPCS method in FEniCS.

Second, we move to the two-phase flow using phase-field model. 

We consider a mixture of two immiscible, incompressible fluids with densities ρ1, ρ2 and viscosities μ1, μ2. In order to identify the regions occupied by the two fluids, we introduce a phase function $\phi$ such that 

$$ \phi = 1 or -1$$

The biggest difference in the Navier-Stokes equation in phase-field model is stress tensor T. There is a additional term, capillary tensor. so the stress tensor

$$T = T(u,p) = 2\mu D(u) - p \delta - \lambda(\nabla \phi nabla \phi)$$

where $\lambda$ is the mixing energy density. Then we can get the weak form of Naiver-stokes equation in phase-field model and compute it using IPCS method in FEniCS.


Cahn–Hilliard phase equation  
(2.4) φt + (u · ∇)φ = −γΔ(Δφ − f(φ)), 

ρ and μ are slave variables defined by the linear average (2.9) ρ(φ) = ρ1 −ρ2φ+ ρ1 +ρ2, μ(φ) = μ1 −μ2φ+ μ1 +μ2. 

we find that the Cahn–Hilliard phase-field system (2.4)-(2.10)-(2.11) admits the fol- lowing energy law: 
d 1 λ   
dt Ω 2ρ0|u|2 + 2|∇φ|2 +λF(φ) dx 
(2.13) μ2 2   
= gudx− 2|D(u)| +λγ|∇(Δφ−f(φ))| dx. 


Finally, Time discretizations and their stability analysis. we study time discretizations of the new phase-field model introduced in the last section. The goal is to construct time discretization schemes which satisfy a discrete energy law similar to the continuous case (2.21) and are easy to solve in practice. 
Finally we get the numerical results.
