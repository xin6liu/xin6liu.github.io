<p>一句话总结：学习Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms的主要目的就是知道怎么<code class="highlighter-rouge">strengthen and harden metals</code>。</p>

<p>我们知道 materials may experience two kinds of <strong>deformation</strong>: <strong>elastic</strong> and <strong>plastic</strong>. Plastic deformation is <strong>permanent</strong>, and <strong>strength and hardness</strong> are <strong>measures of a material’s resistance to this deformation (plastic deformation)</strong>.</p>

<p>On a microscopic scale, <strong>plastic deformation</strong> corresponds to 相当于 <strong>the net movement of large numbers of atoms</strong> in response to 因为 an applied stress. During this process, <strong>interatomic bonds</strong> must be <strong>ruptured 破裂</strong> and then <strong>re-formed</strong>. In crystalline solids, plastic deformation most often involves the <strong>motion of dislocations</strong>.</p>

<p>This article discusses the <strong>characteristics of dislocations</strong> and their involvement 参与 in <strong>plastic deformation</strong>. In addition, and probably most important, <strong>several techniques</strong> are presented for <strong>strengthening single-phase metals</strong>, the mechanisms of which are described in terms of 关于 dislocations. Finally, the latter sections of this article are concerned with <strong>recovery</strong> and <strong>recrystallization</strong> processes that occur in <strong>plastically deformed metals</strong>, normally at elevated temperatures and, in addition, <strong>grain growth</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="一dislocations">一、Dislocations</h2>

<h3 id="basic-concepts">Basic Concepts:</h3>

<p><strong>burger vector: </strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>magnitude : inter atomic spacing</li>
  <li>direction: points in a close-packed crystallographic direction</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>nature of dislocation</strong> is defined by relative orientation of b &amp; dislocation line.</p>

<p><strong>Edge</strong> and <strong>screw</strong> are the two fundamental <strong>dislocation</strong> types.</p>

<p>Plastic deformation corresponds to the motion of large numbers of dislocations.</p>

<p>causes of dislocation formation: 1. exiting dislocation 2. Grain boundaries 3. internal defects &amp; surface scratches and nick.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ozDWA_5UWVqkQUCwzxpw8g.png" alt="" />
Atomic rearrangements that accompany the motion of an edge dislocation as it moves in response to an applied shear stress. (a) The extra half-plane of atoms is labeled A. (b) The dislocation moves one atomic distance to the right as A links up to the lower portion of plane B; in the process, the upper portion of B becomes the extra half-plane. (c) A step forms on the surface of the crystal as the extra half-plane exits.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5gYyM7QZzH0ApffnKkofmw.png" alt="" />
for an <strong>edge</strong>, the <strong>dislocation line</strong> moves in the direction of the applied shear stress t; for a <strong>screw</strong>, the <strong>dislocation line</strong> motion is perpendicular to the stress direction.</p>

<p><strong>Dislocation density</strong> : total dislocation length per unit volume or, equivalently, the number of dislocations that intersect a unit area of a random section.</p>

<p>The units of dislocation density are <strong>millimeters of dislocation per cubic millimeter</strong> or just <strong>per square millimeter</strong>. 
(unit mm of dislocation. $10^{10} mm^{-2}$)</p>

<p>Yield stress increases as dislocation density increases. (dislocation多的那一边：harder to break bonds)</p>

<h3 id="characteristics-of-dislocations">Characteristics of Dislocations</h3>
<p>strain fields that exist around dislocations, which are influential in determining the mobility of the dislocations, as well as their ability to multiply.</p>

<p>As a consequence, there are regions in which compressive, tensile, and shear lattice strains are imposed on the neighboring atoms.</p>

<p>video: Why do Defects Strengthen Metals?</p>

Regions of compression (green) and tension (yellow) located around an edge dislocation.</p>

(a) Two edge dislocations of the same sign and lying on the same slip plane exert a repulsive force on each other; C and T denote compression and tensile regions, respectively. (b) Edge dislocations of opposite sign and lying on the same slip plane exert an attractive force on each other. Upon meeting, they annihilate each other and leave a region of perfect crystal.</p>

<h3 id="slipsystems">Slipsystems</h3>
<p>The <strong>slip plane</strong> is the plane that has the densest atomic packing—that is, has the <strong>greatest planar density</strong>. The <strong>slip direction</strong> corresponds to the direction <strong>in this plane</strong> that is most closely packed with atoms—that is, has the <strong>highest linear density</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="二mechanisms-of-strengthening-in-metals">二、Mechanisms of Strengthening in Metals</h2>

<p><strong>Metallurgical and materials engineers</strong> are often <strong>called on</strong> to design alloys having <strong>high strengths</strong> yet some <strong>ductility and toughness</strong>; typically, <strong>ductility</strong> is sacrificed when an alloy is <strong>strengthened</strong>. Several <strong>hardening techniques</strong> are at the <strong>disposal</strong> of an engineer, and <strong>frequently alloy selection</strong> depends on the <strong>capacity</strong> of a material to be <strong>tailored</strong> with the mechanical characteristics required for a particular application.</p>

<h4 id="why-do-defects-strengthen-materials">why do defects strengthen materials?</h4>
<p>more defects -&gt; harder for dislocations to move -&gt; less plastic deformation -&gt; higher strength and hardness</p>

<p>(more defects = high <strong>strength</strong> = high <strong>hardness</strong> = low <strong>ductility</strong>)</p>

<h3 id="outline">Outline</h3>
<p>Three ways to strengthen materials:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>reduce the grain size: increases  total grain boundary area (2D)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>solid solution hardening: add impurity atoms (0D)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>strain hardening: cold working = increase dislocation density (1D)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-strengthening-by-grain-size-reduction">1. STRENGTHENING BY GRAIN SIZE REDUCTION</h3>
<p>The grain boundary acts as a barrier to dislocation motion: 1. different orientations; 2. discontinuity of slip planes<br />
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MGQCbaFkgEogVxqi_nR2uA.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hall–Petch equation: the yield strength $\sigma_y$ varies with grain size:
<script type="math/tex">\sigma\_y = \sigma\_0 +k\_y d^{-1/2}</script></p>

<h3 id="2-solid-solution-strengthening">2. SOLID-SOLUTION STRENGTHENING</h3>

<p>solid-solution strengthening: alloying with impurity atoms that go into either substitutional or interstitial solid solution.</p>

<p>Alloys are stronger than pure metals because <strong>impurity atoms that go into solid solution</strong> typically <strong>impose lattice strains</strong> on the surrounding host atoms. <strong>Lattice strain field</strong> interactions between dislocations and these impurity atoms result, and, consequently, dislocation movement is restricted.</p>

<h3 id="3-strain-hardening">3. STRAIN HARDENING</h3>
<p><strong>Strain hardening (work hardening, cold working) </strong>is the phenomenon by which a ductile metal becomes harder and stronger as it is <strong>plastically deformed</strong>.</p>

<p>express the degree of plastic deformation as <strong>percent cold work (%CW) </strong>：</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\%CW = (\frac{A\_0-A\_d}{A\_0}) \times 100\%</script>
